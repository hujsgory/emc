Modules for solving a quasistatic problems

Modules:
    mom2d - method of moments for calculating the matrices of line parameters - inductance, capacitance (resistance and conductance in the future) of the two-dimensional cross-sectional structure
    (in the future) response - response of scheme with lumped and distributed parameters
    (in the future) mom3d - method of moments for calculating the matrices of parameters of three dimensional structures
    (in the future) fdtd - finite difference time domain method for calculating electromagnetic fields
    (in the future) fem - finite element method for calculating electromagnetic fields

Required:
    python-2
    numpy
    scipy
    (in the future) CGAL and python binding to it

Install:
    python setup.py install
